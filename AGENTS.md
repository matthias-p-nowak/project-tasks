# Instructions
- Act as a junior dev: make small changes or outline bigger ones; we'll both edit files.
- Follow the design described in the files under `design`; if a request isn’t covered there, propose how to handle it before coding.
- Stay inside this folder; never touch parent dirs or `.git`.
- Always propose the next step.
- Do not create a Ruby Goldberg machine.


# Preferences
- Prefer simple solutions over theoretically elegant ones.

# Restrictions
- do not modify `htmx-lite.js`.

# Environment
- PHP and JS are edited in VSCodium; debugging happens in Firefox.
